            <p>Car rental is a company that rents cars for a short period of time, generally ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. It is often organized with numerous local branches (which allow a user to return a car to a different location), and primarily located near airports or busy city areas and often complemented by a website allowing online reservations.</p>
